# BIRD SPECIES CLASSIFICATION 
### Abstract
Bird species classification plays a crucial role in ecology and conservation efforts, aiding in the understanding of bird populations, biodiversity, and the impact of human activity on communities. 
Traditional methods of classification based on visual inspection are time-consuming, prone to errors, and require extensive knowledge.
This research aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically Vision Transformer (ViT), to develop an accurate and efficient bird classification model.
By training the model on a large dataset of bird images, including rare and unusual species, automated systems can accurately identify bird species with high accuracy.
These systems have various applications, from citizen science projects to conservation and management efforts. 
They can be used to monitor bird populations, track changes in their distribution and behavior over time, and identify species at risk for targeted protection strategies.
The expected outcome of this research is the development of a state-of-the-art bird species classification model. This model will assist ecologists, conservationists, and wildlife managers in better understanding and protecting the diversity of bird species. 
It will also enable comprehensive studies of bird behavior and distribution, contributing to the overall knowledge and conservation efforts in the field of ornithology.
